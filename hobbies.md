## And the \#1 spot goes to...
Video games. I absolutely *love* playing video games, but I am a bit more partial to PC games over any other platform to be honest. Quite like a lot of other people pursuing an education in computer science my age, video games were a major influence in my decision. Although I don't have grand aspirations of making video games in the future, I am definitely still down to do so if given the opportunity. Currently, my favorite game to play is *Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege*. If you also play, hit me up!

As a close second favorite hobby, I'm also very into Japanese popular culture; anime and manga/light novels are where it's at. My favorite anime of all time would have to be *Violet Evergarden*; it's a beautifully-animated show with a deep and touching story, so I highly recommend it!

Besides video games and anime, I also take great pleasure in practicing martial arts, participating in Scouting and related activities, learning languages, and making/listening to music. I'll talk more about these down below.


## Martial Arts (I'm not the Karate Kid, sorry)
Ever since I was 5 years old, I've been practicing martial arts. **Taekwondo**, to be exact. If you don't know what that is and or somehow have never heard of it before, it's a Korean martial art that focuses on kicking techniques and emphasizes the personal development of respect, discipline, honor, and health. For the majority of my life I've been practicing taekwondo, and I have that to thank for me being relatively in shape and healthy to this day.

As a result of my dedication and hard work throughout the past many years, I've also managed to earn my **3rd degree black belt**. I'm quite proud of this accomplishment, as not many people even make it to a black belt in the first place. When I was younger, I used to also be a prominent fighter in the competitive scene as well. Out of the ~20 tournaments I've competed in at the regional, state, national, and international levels, I've managed to earn:
- **11** *bronze medals*
- **2** *silver medals*
- **5** *gold medals*

Not a perfect track record by any means, but I've at least managed to place in nearly all of the tournaments I've attended. Plus, one of those medals was earned at the **2011 U.S. National Championships**, or otherwise known as the **2011 Junior Olympics** for the youngsters competing. Although I don't compete anymore (no brain damage, please), I still look back at those experiences with pride at what I've accomplished.

Besides taekwondo, I also have experience in **judo** and **kendo**, both Japanese martial arts. Judo is characterized by throwing and takedowns, while kendo is known for being a sword-fighting sport. Although I have barely a fraction of experience in these two other martial arts compared to taekwondo, I still greatly enjoy practicing them and I consider myself to be at least somewhat decent and knowledgeable.

## Scouting and those kinds of things
