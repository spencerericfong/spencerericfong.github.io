## And the \#1 spot goes to...
Video games. I absolutely *love* playing video games, but I am a bit more partial to PC games over any other platform to be honest. Quite like a lot of other people pursuing an education in computer science my age, video games were a major influence in my decision. Although I don't have grand aspirations of making video games in the future, I am definitely still down to do so if given the opportunity. Currently, my favorite game to play is *Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege*. If you also play, hit me up!
As a close second favorite hobby, I'm also very into Japanese popular culture; anime and manga/light novels are where it's at. My favorite anime of all time would have to be *Violet Evergarden*; it's a beautifully-animated show with a deep and touching story, so I highly recommend it!

Besides video games and anime, I also take great pleasure in practicing martial arts, participating in Scouting and related activities, learning languages, and making/listening to music. I'll talk more about these down below.
