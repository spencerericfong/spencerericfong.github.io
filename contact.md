I'm currently working on a collaborative project already, however once that completes I'll definitely be open to joining another project if anyone is looking for team members! This page will be updated accordingly as well.

If you'd be interested in contacting me for whatever reason, feel free to send an email over to: **spencerericfong@gmail.com**

(This probably won't be a problem at all, but please don't spam me.)

Also, if you're so inclined please connect with me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/spencer-eric-fong), I'd greatly appreciate it.

Otherwise, go ahead and check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/spencerericfong), or my [projects](/projects.html)!
