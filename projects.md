## Personal Game [Title TBD] (February 2019 - Present)
I'm currently working on a **Windows/MacOS standalone game** built using the **Unity** game engine. Although it's still in fairly early stages of development, I'm already super excited to see how it will end up as we continue to work on it. Our vision for the game is for it to be an isometric-designed horde shooter; something very simple to pick up and play yet challenging and varied enough to keep playing. It's heavily inspired by my submission for the **2019 Global Game Jam**, which you can check out below.

I'm working on the game with 4 other friends of mine, so there's a total of 5 people total in the team. In order to manage the project and make stable progress, we've adopted the **scrum framework**; this allows each member to focus on specific tasks and has resulted in us having productive sprints. If all things continue to go well, we're hoping to have a complete game out by **May 2019**.


## Global Game Jam (January 2019)

I participated in the **2019 Global Game Jam**, which took place from *January 25 - January 27*. The GGJ is a yearly event where people all around the world with a passion for video games come together to create a game of their own based off of the chosen theme for the year, either by themselves or with a team. For this event, I got together with 4 friends of mine to not just create a game to submit, but to also gain experience in game development.

We created our submission in the **Unity** game engine, as a WebGL-based game. The game itself is strikingly similar to my current personal game project; it is a horde shooter set in an isometric designed world. This was mine and several of my teammate's first times working in **Unity** and **C#**, and it was definitely an extremely educational and rewarding experience, especially since we did manage to get a working prototype submitted.

## CyberCTF @ UCI (April 2018)

The cybersecurity club on campus, **Cyber @ UCI**, hosts yearly **CyberCTF** competitions that any students can participate and compete in. CyberCTF stands for cyber capture the flag, which is a competition used as a learning tool where participants use their skills and tools to solve various puzzles that encompass **cybersecurity** and its principles. For example, in this CyberCTF there were cipher puzles, logic riddles, web vulnerability attacking, and more.

I competed in a team consisting of myself and one other friend of mine. It was both of our first times dealing with cybersecurity exercises, and personally I found it to be not only substantially educational, but also a whole lot of fun. It's always neat to be seeing movie "hackers" doing all kinds of crazy things, but to be actually doing what they do (at least in principle, it's not nearly as flashy or fast) was really cool. Our hard work paid off too, because my team placed at the **\#10** spot out of nearly 40 total teams.


## Hack @ UCI (February 2018)

Hack @ UCI was my first ever hackathon, and most definitely wouldn't be my last. For nearly *48 hours straight* with no sleep, I, along with a friend, grinded away at our laptops. As it was my first time experiencing the intense, no-time-to-waste atmosphere of a hackathon, I really pushed myself to keep making progress at all costs. Although it was really tough at times, I definitely came out a better programmer for the experience, and my newfound cramming skills have definitely come in handy since then.

The project I worked on at the event was supposed to be a **facial recognition security program**, however due to inexperience and long set-up times we unfortunately couldn't finish the whole application. However, we still managed to complete the facial recognition part of the program and part of the back end security portion. The application was built in **Python**, utilizing the **OpenCV** library and a number of open source facial recognition libraries. For the camera itself, my partner and I used a **Raspberry Pi 3** module with a camera add-on.
