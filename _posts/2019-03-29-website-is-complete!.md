After over a week of grinding several hours each day, I'm finally done building this site! As of now I finally think that it's complete enough to be publicized, although I do still have some more projects to add on here once I get back to school. But for now, I'm proud of myself for getting everything done and working so hard, because this is a pretty decent job for my first experience with webdev. Now to start actually applying for internships...

TO-DO:
- Add a nice looking profile picture of myself to the front page
- Upload some interesting school projects (*Columns*) to GitHub and [projects](/projects.html) page
- Proofread literally everything and make adjustments to text and all so thing sound indicative

But for now, I'm off to play and relax.
