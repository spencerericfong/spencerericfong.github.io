## UCI Esports Arena (April 2018 - Present)
![UCI Esports](assets/pictures/UCI_Esports.jpg)

I currently work at the [UCI Esports Arena](https://esports.uci.edu/arena/), which is a public gaming hub located on campus that provides top-of-the-line desktops preloaded with all the latest, most popular games for guests to use for an hourly fee. UCI is one of the leaders in promoting collegiate and scholastic gaming, and the Esports Arena is just one of the many accomplishments of the school's Esports program.

My role as a member of the student staff force is to ensure guests at the Arena enjoy their time at the establishment to the fullest, and have an overall fun and comfortable experience. I am responsible for processing and logging all **monetary transactions** at the Arena, which consists of customers purchasing hours to use the computers. I am also in charge of maintaining Arena **cleanliness and orderliness**; maintaining a clean environment is not only a matter of professionalism but safety as well. Furthermore, I am responsible for **providing technical support** and troubleshooting help for any issues that arise with the equipment, have it be the computers, systems, or other equipment such as consoles or TVs. Additionally, when there are events such as meetings, tournaments, or parties hosted at the Arena, I am in charge of **event execution**; making sure all events run smoothly and on time is of major importance.

My experience working at the Arena has immensely developed my skills as a member of a team. Not only have my interpersonal and communication skills grown considerably, I have also become highly proficient in being able to juggle many different tasks at a time and complete them all within a reasonable amount of time based upon priority. I have also learned a considerable amount about collegiate gaming, which I believe has the potential to grow into a major facet of the overarching "university experience" within the US, as well as around the world.


## Lim's Taekwondo (August 2015 - July 2017)

*Lim's Taekwondo* is a taekwondo studio located in Alameda, California. It is run by grandmaster Chris Lim, an 8th degree black belt and extremely prestigious member of the global taekwondo community. The studio provides Olympic-style taekwondo classes for all age groups, from youth to teens to adults, and emphasizes the development of discipline, respect, honor, and health.

Before leaving for university, I was an instructor at *Lim's Taekwondo*. As a **3rd degree black belt** and **decorated competitor**, I had the skills and knowledge to be an instructor and lead classes on my own. I was responsible for leading mainly the youth classes, which consisted of anywhere between **10 - 20 students** on average, all around elementary and middle school age. During class, I would lead the students as a group in warmup exercises at first, then move on to more strenuous exercises and technique practice. For the full hour that classes would last for, I would focus on giving each student adequate amounts of personal help and making sure that everyone was not only participating and doing their best, but having a good time.

Working as an instructor definitely boosted my interpersonal and communication skills, as that was a good 90% of the entire job. It was also my first experience working for a company rather than being self-employed, which was essential in developing my work ethic and responsibility as an employee. I believe that my time working in this position was a positive and ideal first step into the working world, as I have grown considerably thanks to it.
