## UCI Esports Arena (April 2018 - Present)
![UCI Esports](assets/pictures/UCI_Esports.jpg)

I currently work at the [UCI Esports Arena](https://esports.uci.edu/arena/), which is a public gaming hub located on campus that provides top-of-the-line desktops preloaded with all the latest, most popular games for guests to use for an hourly fee. UCI is one of the leaders in promoting collegiate and scholastic gaming, and the Esports Arena is just one of the many accomplishments of the school's Esports program.

My role as a member of the student staff force is to ensure guests at the Arena enjoy their time at the establishment to the fullest, and have an overall fun and comfortable experience. I am responsible for processing and logging all **monetary transactions** at the Arena, which consists of customers purchasing hours to use the computers. I am also in charge of maintaining Arena **cleanliness and orderliness**; maintaining a clean environment is not only a matter of professionalism but safety as well. Furthermore, I am responsible for **providing technical support** and troubleshooting help for any issues that arise with the equipment, have it be the computers, systems, or other equipment such as consoles or TVs. Additionally, when there are events such as meetings, tournaments, or parties hosted at the Arena, I am in charge of **event execution**; making sure all events run smoothly and on time is of major importance.

My experience working at the Arena has immensely developed my skills as a member of a team. Not only have my interpersonal and communication skills grown considerably, I have also become highly proficient in being able to juggle many different tasks at a time and complete them all within a reasonable amount of time based upon priority. I have also learned a considerable amount about collegiate gaming, which I believe has the potential to grow into a major facet of the overarching "university experience" within the US, as well as around the world.
