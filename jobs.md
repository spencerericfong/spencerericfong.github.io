## Jumpstart.me (April 2019 - Present) | Growth Marketing Intern
![Jumpstart.me](assets/pictures/Jumpstart_banner.png)

Currently, I am a growth marketing intern for [Jumpstart](https://jumpstart.me), which is a diverse platform of engineering and computer science students and companies that hire them. It serves as both a social networking platform for students to connect with each other as well as a hiring platform for the affiliated companies to acquire new talent for internship and full-time positions.

At Jumpstart, my role is basically that of a **community ambassador**, someone who is responsible for enabling and contributing to the growth of the platform through traditional and modern outreach techniques. As a growth marketing intern at UCI, I have done much to spread Jumpstart's presence on campus and within the UCI community. I have maintained an active presence on online forums and have introduced many of my peers to Jumpstart both through those forums as well as in person. I have also participated in discussion with company representatives about how to improve the platform as well as how to gain and retain more users. Thanks to my efforts and the efforts of my fellow interns and coworkers, Jumpstart has over **40,000 active users**, and that number continues to grow each day.

I am really grateful for the opportunity to work at Jumpstart. The platform has truly grown by leaps and bounds since I've joined, and I am proud of what an incredible community the platform has managed to foster. Its in-house forums are always bustling with activity, and users, who are students just like me, are all so positive and supportive of each other. I believe my experience here has really enabled me to learn more about the kind of work culture I prefer and thrive in, and I hope that I too will continue to learn and grow alongside Jumpstart itself.


## UCI Esports Arena (April 2018 - Present) | Student Staff

I also currently work at the [UCI Esports Arena](https://esports.uci.edu/arena/), which is a public gaming hub located on campus that provides top-of-the-line desktops preloaded with all the latest, most popular games for guests to use for an hourly fee. UCI is one of the leaders in promoting collegiate and scholastic gaming, and the Esports Arena is just one of the many accomplishments of the university's Esports program.

My role as a member of the student staff force is to ensure guests at the Arena enjoy their time at the establishment to the fullest, and have an overall fun and comfortable experience. I am responsible for processing and logging all **monetary transactions** at the Arena, which consists of customers purchasing hours to use the computers. I am also in charge of maintaining Arena **cleanliness and orderliness**; maintaining a clean environment is not only a matter of professionalism but safety as well. Furthermore, I am responsible for **providing technical support** and troubleshooting help for any issues that arise with the equipment, have it be the computers, systems, or other equipment such as consoles or TVs. Additionally, when there are events such as meetings, tournaments, or parties hosted at the Arena, I am in charge of **event execution**; making sure all events run smoothly and on time is of major importance.

My experience working at the Arena has immensely developed my skills as a member of a team. Not only have my interpersonal and communication skills grown considerably, I have also become highly proficient in being able to juggle many different tasks at a time and complete them all within a reasonable amount of time based upon priority. I have also learned a considerable amount about collegiate gaming, which I believe has the potential to grow into a major facet of the overarching "university experience" within the US, as well as around the world.


## Lim's Taekwondo (August 2015 - July 2017) | Assistant Instructor
![Lim's TKD](assets/pictures/Lim's_TKD.png)

*Lim's Taekwondo* is a taekwondo studio located in Alameda, California. It is run by grandmaster Chris Lim, an 8th degree black belt and extremely prestigious member of the global taekwondo community. The studio provides Olympic-style taekwondo classes for all age groups, from youth to teens to adults, and emphasizes the development of discipline, respect, honor, and health.

Before leaving for university, I was an instructor at *Lim's Taekwondo*. As a **3rd degree black belt** and **decorated competitor**, I had the skills and knowledge to be an instructor and lead classes on my own. I was responsible for leading mainly the youth classes, which consisted of anywhere between **10 - 30 students** on average, all around elementary and middle school age. During class, I would lead the students as a group in warmup exercises at first, then move on to more strenuous exercises and technique practice. For the full hour that classes would last for, I would focus on giving each student adequate amounts of personal help and making sure that everyone was not only participating and doing their best, but having a good time.

Working as an instructor definitely boosted my interpersonal and communication skills, as that was a good 90% of the entire job. It was also my first experience working for a company rather than being self-employed, which was essential in developing my work ethic and responsibility as an employee. I believe that my time working in this position was a positive and ideal first step into the working world, as I have grown considerably thanks to it.


## Private Tutor (January 2013 - July 2017) | Self Employed
![Tutor](assets/pictures/Good-Grades.jpg)

My very first experience having any sort of job whatsoever was as a private tutor while I was in high school. When I was younger, I really excelled in school and always got top marks, so I figured I could put some of that knowledge to use as a tutor. I already knew a couple of people parents who were interested in finding some extra academic help for their elementary or middle schoolers, so I offered my services and began to tutor them.

I would have one-on-one sessions with each student, usually for about an hour or so after school, where I would help them with homework and go over classwork from the day that they may have had some trouble with. The subjects were all encompassing; I tutored **English**, **math**, **science**, and **social studies**. I would also formulate simple practice exercises to complement their homework so that they could get extra experience in concepts they were having trouble with. Other than being there to help with academics, I also indirectly served as a sort of "older brother" figure to many of my students, as I was constantly trying to set a proper example for them in terms of **responsibility**, **discipline**, and **work ethic**. As a result of my efforts (and theirs too of course), all of my students were able to improve their grades and understanding of their school subjects.

As the same is with many others, my first job was an incredible learning experience that really introduced me to what "having a job" entails: responsibilities, expectations, dedication, and of course hard work. I was also able to develop my interpersonal and communication skills, as well as skills needed to be a good teacher. Tutoring has made me realize that teaching someone else how to do something is one of the best ways to learn even more, and I try to pursue that ideal even today with my own coursework.
