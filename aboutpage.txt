#About me

My name is Spencer Eric Fong, and I was born on February 16, 1999 in San Francisco, California. I'm half Korean and half Chinese, and as of right now I'm 20 years old.
I've lived in the Bay Area all the way up until I entered college and started attending the University of California, Irvine as a computer science major. If all things go well and I keep up my academic success, I'll be graduating in June 2021. Go Anteaters! Zot zot zot!


##Why Computer Science?
My entire life I've been fascinated with computers and technology in general. My dad is a retired programmer, and his passion for computers and the like really rubbed off on me. I've been tinkering around with computers since I was a little kid, and to this day I still love it when I get to put together a new build or upgrade my own rig. I knew from a young age that when I grew up, I wanted to work with computers.
Surprisingly enough though, my first experience with actual coding was all the way in my senior year of high school, when I took AP Computer Science and learned how to program in Java. It was a challenging but extremely rewarding class, and did a whole lot to enforce my decision of going into computer science in university. And as luck would have it, I was accepted into UCI as a computer science major and here I am 2 full years later. It's definitely not easy, but I love what I learn and I'm so excited to see what the future holds for me on this journey of mine through college.
