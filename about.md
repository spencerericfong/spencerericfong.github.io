My name is Spencer Eric Fong, and I was born on February 16, 1999 in San Francisco, California. I'm half Korean and half Chinese, and as of right now I'm 20 years old.
I've lived in the Bay Area all the way up until I entered college and started attending the University of California, Irvine as a computer science major. If all things go well and I keep up my academic success, I'll be graduating in June 2021. Go Anteaters! **Zot zot zot!**


##So, why Computer Science?
My entire life I've been fascinated with computers and technology in general. My dad is a retired programmer, and his passion for computers and the like really rubbed off on me. I've been tinkering around with computers since I was a little kid, and to this day I still love it when I get to put together a new build or upgrade my own rig. I knew from a young age that when I grew up, I wanted to work with computers.

Surprisingly enough though, my first experience with actual coding wasn't until my senior year of high school, when I took AP Computer Science and learned how to program in Java. It was a challenging but extremely rewarding class, and did a whole lot to enforce my decision of going into computer science in university. And as luck would have it, I was accepted into UCI as a computer science major and here I am 2 full years later. It's definitely not easy, but I love what I do and I'm so excited to keep on learning.

Ever since then, I've learned so much and have grown leaps and bounds as a programmer. By now, I would go so far as to say I'm definitely competent and worth my salt, and along with everything else I bring to the table I'm confident I'd be a valuable asset to any team or project. (*wink wink* Please hire me, thanks.) I still have so much to improve on though, and it's my dream that as I gain more and more experience I'll be able to one day become that "programming whiz" that people like to tell their kids and friends about as being a real smarty.
