# Hi, I'm Spencer!

Welcome to my site. This is the place that I'll be showcasing different projects I've worked on, the fruits of my labor at various coding events, as well as other interesting things about me like extracurriculars and hobbies and all that fun stuff. I hope that this site will help you to learn a little more about me, and to gain some insight into what kinds of things I'm interested in.

The site may be a little rough around the edges since this is my first experiment into webdev, but enjoy your stay and thank you so much for stopping by!
